                  Illumeet values its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy
                  ("Policy") will help you understand how we collect and use
                  personal information from those who visit our website or make
                  use of our online facilities and services, and what we will
                  and will not do with the information we collect. Our Policy
                  has been designed and created to ensure our commitment and
                  realization of our obligation not only to meet but to exceed
                  most existing privacy standards.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any
                  given time. If you want to make sure
                  <br />
                  that you are up to date with the latest changes, we advise you
                  to frequently visit this page. If at
                  <br />
                  any point in time Illumeet decides to make use of any
                  personally identifiable information on file, in a manner
                  vastly different from that which was stated when this
                  information was initially collected, the user or users shall
                  be promptly notified by email. Users at that time shall have
                  the option as to whether to permit the use of their
                  information in this separate manner.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This Policy applies to Illumeet, and it governs any and all
                  data collection and usage by us. Through the use of

                  <br />
                  Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection
                  and use of information by companies that Illumeet does not
                  control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If
                  you visit a website that we mention or link to, be sure to
                  review its privacy policy before providing the site with
                  information. It is highly recommended and suggested that you
                  review the privacy policies and statements of any website you
                  choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in
                  which websites garner, make use of, and share the information
                  collected.

                  Illumeet offers to its users a website, online facilities, and
                  services, some of which are primarily for users above the age
                  of 13, and others that are intended for users of all ages and
                  their families. Below, we summarize potential instances of
                  collection and outline how and when we will provide parental
                  notice and/or seek parental consent. In any instance that we

                  participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our

                  Children can, in many cases, register with our websites and
                  online facilities and services to view content, participate in
                  contests, and engage in special features, among other things.
                  During the registration process, we may ask the child to
                  provide certain information for notification and security
                  purposes, including a parent or guardian’s email address, the
                  child’s first name, the location, child’s member or account
                  username, and password. We also may ask for birth dates from
                  children to validate their ages. We strongly advise children
                  never to provide any personal information in their usernames.
                  Please note that children can choose whether to share their
                  information with us, but certain features cannot function
                  without it. As a result, children may not be able to access
                  certain features if required information has not been
                  provided. We will not require a child to provide more
                  information than is reasonably necessary in order to
                  participate in an online activity.

                  that we delete from our records the personal information we
                  have collected in connection with that registration. Please
                  keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to
                  registration termination and as a result, children may not be

                  you submit sensitive information via the website, your
                  information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we
                  collect sensitive information (e.g. credit card information),
                  that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a
                  secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in
                  the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of

                  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific
                  job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted
                  access to personally identifiable information. The computers
                  and servers in which we store personally identifiable
                  information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done
                  to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
                  or modification of the user's personal information under our
